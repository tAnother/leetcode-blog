## About this site

Daily leetcode blog for practicing with [代码随想录](https://programmercarl.com/). Made by a leetcode hater with luv ♥

The languages I use:

I would say I'm probably OK with Python, probably fairly familiar with C, somehow comfortable with Go (or really? idk), and currently learning Java. Most of the leetcode solutions on this site would be in Java.


I intend to use English for most of the contents but expect some Chinese as well from time to time.
