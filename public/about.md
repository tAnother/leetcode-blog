Daily leetcode blog for practicing with [代码随想录](). 

About the language I use:

I would say I'm OK with Python, fairly familiar with C, somehow comfortable with Go (or really? idk), currently trying to learn Java.


I intend to use English for most of the contents but expect some Chinese as well from time to time.
