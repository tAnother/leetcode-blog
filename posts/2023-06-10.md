## 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs
[https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs)

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.

First version: Somehow ugly. No clear logic. 

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode curr = head, prev = null;
        head = curr.next;
        while (curr != null && curr.next != null) {
            ListNode n = curr.next, nn = curr.next.next;
            if (prev != null) prev.next = n;
            n.next = curr;
            curr.next = nn;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nn;
        } 
        return head;
    }
}
```

This one might looks neater:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1, head);    // use dummy head to avoid dealing with edge case
        ListNode curr = dummy;
        while (curr.next != null && curr.next.next != null) {   // pay attention to the condition
            ListNode n = curr.next, nn = curr.next.next, nnn = curr.next.next.next;
            curr.next = nn;
            nn.next = n;
            n.next = nnn;
            curr = n;
        } 
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```


## 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List
[https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

Java:
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        int length = 0;
        ListNode curr = head;
        for (; curr != null; curr = curr.next) length++;    // get the length first
        if (n == length) return head.next;      // could use a dummy head, but handling edge case seems faster :p
        curr = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < length - n - 1; i++) curr = curr.next;  // get to the node proceeding the one to be removed
        curr.next = curr.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```

With only one pass, we could use slow-fast pointers: 

let the fast pointer move forward n steps first (so that fast and slow are n steps away), then move both pointers together. When fast hit the end, slow is at one node preceeding toDelete; when fast hit null, slow is at the node toDelete. 
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) fast = fast.next;
        if (fast == null) return slow.next;
        while (fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        slow.next = slow.next.next;
        return head;
    }
}
```


## 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
[https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

Java:
```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        // calculate the length of each list
        int al = 0, bl = 0;
        for (ListNode curr = headA; curr != null; curr = curr.next) al++;
        for (ListNode curr = headB; curr != null; curr = curr.next) bl++;

        // let the pointer to the longer list move `difference` steps first
        ListNode pa = headA, pb = headB;
        if (al > bl) 
            for (int i = 0; i < al-bl; i++) pa = pa.next;
        else 
            for (int i = 0; i < bl-al; i++) pb = pb.next;

        // move pointers together
        while (pa != pb && pa != null && pb != null) {
            pa = pa.next;
            pb = pb.next;
        }
        if (pa == null || pb == null) return null;
        return pa;
    }
}
```

## 142. Linked List Cycle II
[https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

We can use hashset (O(N) memory). To achieve O(1) memory, use pointers only.

Finding whether there is cycle is easy (use slow-fast pointers). Finding wheer the cycle begins involves some complicated math...

Let's break it down (see [origin](https://programmercarl.com/0142.%E7%8E%AF%E5%BD%A2%E9%93%BE%E8%A1%A8II.html#%E6%80%9D%E8%B7%AF)). 

![img](https://code-thinking-1253855093.file.myqcloud.com/pics/20220925103433.png)

x = num nodes before cycle start;

y = num nodes from start to where slow & fast met;

z = num nodes from where slow & fast met to start; (i.e. y + z = num nodes in cycle)

slow has gone through: x + y nodes;

fast has gone through: x + n(y + z) nodes, where n is how many cycles it has completed;

then because fast is always 2 times faster than slow, we have the equation: 2 * (x + y) = x + n(y + z) --> x = (n - 1) (y + z) + z

that means, if one pointer start from the beginning, the other start from z, they'll finally meet at the beginning of the cycle

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode detectCycle(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        // see if cycle exists
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;

            if (fast == slow) { // cycle detected
                // let one start from head, the other start from wher\e slow & fast met
                slow = head;
                while (slow != fast) {
                    slow = slow.next;
                    fast = fast.next;
                }
                return slow;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
