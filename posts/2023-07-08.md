### Review
- 45 & 55

## [122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii)
- Greedy: Buy only when the price tomorrow is higher; sell only when the price yesterday was lower.

- DP (less intuitive): let dp[i][0] = max balance if we don't buy stock today;  dp[i][1] = max balance if we buy stock today.

    Since you can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time, if you bought it yesterday, you cannot buy it today (but you got the profit from selling it). So we have: 

    dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] + prices[i]);  dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][0] - prices[i], dp[i-1][1])

    base case: dp[0][0] = 0;  dp[0][1] = -prices[0]



## [55. Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
I wouldn't even think about using greedy algo for this problem without looking at the solution...Let's just get straight into the solution: Don't think of it as jumping, as we get to choose how many steps to jump as long as it does not exceed the limit. Think of it as coloring grids. All colored grids are reachable.

```java
public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 1) return true;

    int coveredInd = 0; // last covered index
    // why is it just one (end) index not a range (start, end)? 
    // -- according to the condition, if a higher index is covered 
    // -- then a lower index must also be covered

    for (int i = 0; i <= coveredInd; i++) {
        if (nums[i] + i > coveredInd) coveredInd = nums[i] + i;
        if (coveredInd >= nums.length - 1) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
```

## [45. Jump Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)
This one somehow seems like a backtracking problem to me...

The most important thing is to figure out when we should increment step count--When current covered index is still smaller than the length.


```java
public int jump(int[] nums) {
    if (nums.length == 1) return 0;
    
    int curCoveredInd = 0;
    int nextCoveredInd = 0; // coverage if we take another step
    int steps = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        nextCoveredInd = Math.max(nextCoveredInd, nums[i] + i);
        if (i == curCoveredInd) {   // reached the maximum we can reach in current round
            steps++;    // need to take another step
            curCoveredInd = nextCoveredInd;
            if (nextCoveredInd >= nums.length - 1) break;
        }
    }
    return steps;
}
```
